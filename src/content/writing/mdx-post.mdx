# Introduction to MDX

MDX is a powerful format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. It's the perfect combination of markup and components.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use Markdown's terse syntax (such as # heading) for your content and import React components to render them within your Markdown.

### Benefits of MDX

1. **Flexibility**: Write in Markdown, use React components.
2. **Reusability**: Create and reuse components across your documentation.
3. **Developer-friendly**: Familiar syntax for both content writers and developers.

## Example

Here's an example of how we can use our custom BlogCard component in MDX:

<BlogCard post={{
  slug: "example-post",
  data: {
    title: "Example Post",
    excerpt: "This is an example of how you can use custom components in MDX.",
  }
}} />

## Code Blocks

MDX supports syntax highlighting in code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('MDX User'));
