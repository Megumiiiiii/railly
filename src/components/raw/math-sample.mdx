# Complex Numbers (Mathematics > Algebra)

## Definition
A complex number $z$ is a number of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit defined by $i^2 = -1$. Formally:

<DisplayLatex formula="\large z = a + bi, \quad \text{where } a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } i^2 = -1" />


## Key Concepts
- Real and imaginary parts
- Complex plane representation
- Modulus and argument
- Complex conjugate

## Important Properties
1. Closure: The sum and product of two complex numbers is a complex number
2. Commutativity: $z_1 + z_2 = z_2 + z_1$ and $z_1 \cdot z_2 = z_2 \cdot z_1$
3. Every complex number has a unique complex conjugate

## Essential Formulas
- Modulus: $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
- Euler's formula: $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$

## Core Examples
1. Simplify $(3 + 2i) + (1 - 5i)$
2. Find the roots of $z^2 + 1 = 0$

## Related Theorems/Rules
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting that $i^2 = -1$ when simplifying expressions
- Incorrectly applying properties of real numbers to complex numbers
