```markdown
Create concise mathematical notes (fenced markdown code block) on the topic "[INSERT TOPIC]" using the following structure:

# [Topic Name] ([Area] > [Subarea])
[e.g., "Mean (Mathematics > Statistics)" or "Complex Numbers (Mathematics > Algebra)"]

## Definition
Provide a clear, formal mathematical definition of the topic. Include:
- A concise verbal explanation of the concept
- The mathematical formula or representation, using LaTeX notation
Example: "For a dataset ${x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$, the arithmetic mean $\bar{x}$ is defined as:
$$\large\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}$$"

## Key Concepts
- [List 3-4 fundamental ideas or principles related to the topic]

## Important Properties
1. [State a key property or characteristic]
2. [State another key property or characteristic]
3. [State a third key property or characteristic, if applicable]

## Essential Formulas
- [Present a crucial formula, using LaTeX notation]
- [Present another crucial formula, if applicable]

## Core Examples
1. [Provide a basic example demonstrating the concept]
2. [Provide a more advanced application or example]

## Related Theorems/Rules
[If applicable, state any important theorems or rules associated with the topic]

## Common Pitfalls
- [Mention a common mistake or misunderstanding]
- [Mention another common mistake or misunderstanding]

## Related Topics
- [List a closely related mathematical topic]
- [List another closely related mathematical topic]

## Quick Review Questions
1. [Pose a question that tests understanding of a key concept]
2. [Pose another question that encourages deeper thinking about the topic]

Ensure the notes are mathematically accurate, concise, and suitable for quick review. Use LaTeX notation for ALL mathematical expressions, including numbers (e.g., $2$, $\pi$). Use double dollar symbols ($$) for display-style equations or main expressions, and single dollar symbols ($) for inline expressions. The area and subarea in the title should reflect the topic's place in the broader mathematical hierarchy. Use double square brackets [[]] to link to related concepts, theorems, or topics, creating connections between different notes.
